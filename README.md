# Overview

This repo was built as a testing grounds to practice creating a GitHub repo, cloning it to my local machine, and making a commit. 

I am also practicing now how to start new projects in JavaScript so that I can prepare to start future projects.

The software I have built here is a simple "Hello World" program that prints the words "Hello World" to the terminal.

At the base of my project I used JavaScript to write the actual functionallity of the program.
